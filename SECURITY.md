### How to Report

Email: support@revenium.io

We will review and respond to security reports in a timely manner.

## Security Best Practices

When using this middleware:

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for sensitive configuration. The middleware loads `.env.local` and `.env` automatically
3. **Prompt Capture**: Off by default. When enabled via `REVENIUM_CAPTURE_PROMPTS=true`, automatic PII sanitization is applied
4. **Network Security**: All connections use HTTPS
5. **Updates**: Keep the package updated to the latest version

## Data Transmission

This middleware sends the following metering data to the Revenium API:
- Provider and model used (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity, LiteLLM, fal.ai)
- Token counts (input, output, cache)
- Latency and streaming status
- Transaction ID for correlation
- Stop reason
- For media providers (fal.ai): media type, dimensions, duration

No conversation content is transmitted unless prompt capture is explicitly enabled. When enabled, PII is automatically sanitized before transmission.
